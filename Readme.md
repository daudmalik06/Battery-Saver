# INTRODUCTION
This will improve your laptop’s battery life.
This app will notify the user to unplug the charger when his/her laptop's battery is fully charged or about to die.

The user will have to set the minimum and maximum battery level threshold. The app can be enabled or disabled by clicking the on/off switch on the main window.
 
I had made a very simple GUI for the app, however, a lot of users messaged me for a better GUI. Due to time constraints from my regular workload I finished this a little later than expected. I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

I’ve put my best efforts into this project, but now it’s your turn to provide me with some feedback. This is a lightweight app, it requires to be run only once after installation, thereafter it will run automatically on windows startup.

Feel free to contact us.

Please send us bug reports, so we can make improvements for you.
